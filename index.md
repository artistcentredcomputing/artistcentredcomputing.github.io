# ACC 2014: Artist-Centred Computing Workshop

### Part of VL/HCC 2014

Computers have had a long history of being used and abused by artists
in their craft, and there are very few programming languages
(including visual languages) which have not been used in service of
this goal. However, few of these languages were designed specifically
by and for artists. Ironically, the humanities are often overlooked in
human-centred computing.

The Artist-Centred Computing workshop is an opportunity to explore the
design objectives and constraints of building programming
languages/environments *for artists*. Rather than considering specific
artworks, it's a chance to wrestle with the technical issues which
arise when designing *systems* for artistic creation. It's a chance
for computer scientists---many of whom have a deep interest in the
arts---can bring their 'day job' expertise to bear on this design
challenge. ACC 2014 is a workshop at the
[2014 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2014/).

# Call for Papers

We are soliciting works with technical and artistic merit, in areas
such as:

- domain-specific languages vs general purpose languages for artistic
  creation: do artists *need* different computing environments from
  the rest of us?
- in-depth technical analyses of and comparisons between
  artist-centred languages
- how do we evaluate languages for artists?
- what would a language designed by Beethoven look like?
  Michaelangelo? Stravinsky?
- livecoding and live patching
- what can artists learn from software engineers?
- artistic vs prosaic software visualisation
- visual languages for artists

And if you think the whole notion of "Artist-Centred Computing" is
just so much rubbish, then submit a paper and argue your case!

# Keynote

**Ross Bencina** is a programmer/artist and the creator of
  [AudioMulch](http://www.audiomulch.com):software for real-time audio
  processing and improvised music performance.
  
# Workshop format

15-20 minute (TBC) presentations (including questions), **live
performance/creation encouraged**. A sweet PA and projector will be
provided---use them!

# Conference Location

Come to Melbourne; hang out in hipster laneway cafes, go to an indie
shoegaze side gig, sink a beer at a rooftop bar. Seriously, we can
hook you up with any of those things. Melbourne is internationally
recognised (by people from Melbourne) as Australia's cultural capital.
