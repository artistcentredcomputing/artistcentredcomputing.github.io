Computers have had a long history of being used and abused by artists
in their craft, and there are very few programming languages
(including visual languages) which have not been used in service of
this goal. However, few of these languages were designed specifically
by and for artists. Ironically, the humanities are often overlooked in
human-centred computing.

This workshop aims to explore the design objectives and constraints of
building programming languages/environments *for artists*. It is a
place where computer scientists---many of whom have a deep interest in
the arts---can bring their 'day job' expertise to bear on this design
challenge.

Artist-Centred Computing is a workshop at the [2014 IEEE Symposium on
  Visual Languages and Human-Centric
  Computing](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2014/)

# Call for Papers

We are soliciting works with technical and artistic merit, in areas
such as:

- domain-specific languages vs general purpose languages: do artists
  *need* different computing environments from the rest of us?
- technical "artist talks": artistic exhibitions/performances with
  analysis from a HCC perspective
- in-depth technical analyses of and comparisons between
  artist-centred languages or created artworks
- how do we evaluate languages for artists?
- what would a language designed by Beethoven look like?
  Michaelangelo? Stravinsky?
- livecoding and live patching
- what can artists learn from software engineers?
- artistic vs prosaic software visualisation
- visual languages for artists

And if you think the whole notion of "Artist-Centred Computing" is
just so much rubbish, then submit a paper and argue your case!
